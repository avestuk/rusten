# Notes

## Cargo
* 

- `Cargo new` creates a standard directory structure and a git repo   
- `Cargo build` builds a binary - it'll land in the `target/debug` directory
- `Cargo build --release` builds a binary for release - it takes longer but adds optimizations
- `Cargo run` builds and runs the binary
- `Cargo check` verifies that the binary compiles
